# Jekyll Theme

## Installation & setup guide

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started)
- [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Running locally

Before you start make sure you have *Ruby* and the gems for *Jekyll* installed locally. You can find out how to do that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

1. Clone your repository locally *(if you haven't already)*
2. `cd <repository-name>`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser.

*Note: You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`.*

# Upload

Upload the whole .git project in your repository and create the *gh-pages* branch. And go to settings in GitHub repo settings to enable hosting website.
