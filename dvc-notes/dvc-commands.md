## DVC (Data Version Control)

It can be used to have version control of data.

### First install these dependencies

```Dependencies
# Make sure to install these dependencies for integrating Google-drive
pip install pydrive2
pip install 'dvc[gdrive]'
```

### Pipeline of working

```Pipeline
# initialized repositary for dvc
dvc init
# .dvc folder is generated for cache stuff

# .dvc file is generated by following command
dvc add [data-folder-name]

# commit [file-name].dvc to Git
git commit [file-name].dvc -m 'raw data added'

# pushing to remote
dvc push -r gdrive
```

### Setting up Remote

```Remote setup
# adding google drive as remote for cache
dvc remote add vgdrive gdrive://1jeWGYafWHxoIGWYQolXHfhOSsaeTnu-7/data

# viewing all the remotes
dvc remote list

# commiting remote config file
git commit .dvc/config -m 'storage configured'
```

**Note: <br> remote name follows this format-** `gdrive://[main-folder-id]/[sub-folder-name]`
